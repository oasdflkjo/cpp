# Learning CPP in win 11 + VSCode environment

I would like to test using ChatGPT as a tool to study new subjects. I'll try to document my progress in this repository and maybe provide some insight on whether a large language model can be useful tool in this context.

I'd like to emphasize that ChatGPT can give seemingly coherent answers, but it can be wrong with unremarkable confidence. ðŸ˜…


### List of topics *(generated by ChatGPT based on my level of knowledge)*

1. Start by reviewing the basics of C++ syntax, such as data types, variables, and control structures. You can do this by working through online tutorials or by reading a C++ textbook.
1. Learn about classes and objects, including how to define classes, create objects, and use member functions.
1. Study templates, including function templates and class templates.
1. Learn about the STL and how to use containers, algorithms, and iterators.
1. Study inheritance and polymorphism, including how to create derived classes and override member functions.
1. Learn about exception handling and how to use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions.
1. Study smart pointers, including how to use unique_ptr and shared_ptr.
1. Practice by working on small projects and exercises to reinforce your understanding of the concepts.
1. Read advanced C++ books and papers to deepen your understanding of the language.

## Project setup
We are using follwing tools:
- cmake
- google test
- clang format
- github actions *(CI/CD)* 

## Tests
https://google.github.io/googletest/quickstart-cmake.html

Dummy test can be run using provided run_tests.ps1. I don't know the best practices for this yet but i guess we will learn that on the way.

## Using Clangformat for Linting Files
We're using clangformat to automatically check and format the syntax of our C/C++ code in this project. Clangformat ensures consistency in our coding style, makes the code easier to read, and reduces the likelihood of errors.

We've integrated clangformat into our build system and configured it to use the Google C++ style guide, which emphasizes readability and simplicity.

1. `winget install llvm.llvm` (contains clang)
2. install vscode extension `Clang-Format`
3. add the following to the vscode settings.json
```json
    "clang-format.executable": "C:/Program Files/LLVM/bin/clang-format.exe",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "[cpp]": {"editor.defaultFormatter": "xaver.clang-format"}
```

*Is there any Build environment things that I have allredy installed that i take granted?*

- *at least cmake*
