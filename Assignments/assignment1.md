## Assignment: C++ Syntax and Data Structures

### Requirements:

1. Write a C++ program that demonstrates the following syntax features:
- Data types (int, double, char, etc.)
- Variables (declaration, initialization, assignment)
- Conditional statements (if-else, switch)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions (declaration, definition, calling)
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Classes and objects

2. Your program should also include at least two functions that perform operations on data structures. For example, you could create a function that sorts an array, or a function that implements a linked list.

3. Write tests for each of the functions you created. You can use a testing framework such as Google Test or Catch2.

### Submission:

1. Submit your program code and test code in a single file.
2. Include a brief write-up that describes your program, the data structures it uses, and how the functions you created work.
3. If you used a testing framework, include instructions on how to run the tests.
